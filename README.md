# Bachelor
This repository contains all the code used in the development of a bachelors thesis
on the subject of mulitple hypothesis testing on social networks using cluster permutation testing.

Main.py holds the code used for the first presented scenario where the hypotheses are purely independent.
Circle.py holds the code used for the second presented scenario where the hypotheses are nodes on a circular graph.
Grid.py holds the code used for the third presented scenario where the hypotheses are nodes on a lattice graph.
CalledSequences holds the code used for various figures and examples throughout the project.

MethodApproach.py can perform the cluster permutation test on different types of graphs.
